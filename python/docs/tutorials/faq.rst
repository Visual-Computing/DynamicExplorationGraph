What problem does deglib solve?
*******************************

The Dynamic Exploration Graph library (deglib) solves the approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search problem.
This involves finding data points that are most similar or "closest" to a given query point in a high-dimensional space, without having to check every single data point.
