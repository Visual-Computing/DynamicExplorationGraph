# crEG: An Exploration Graph with Continuous Refinement for Efficient Multimedia Retrieval

The continuous refining Exploration Graph (crEG) is a graph-based approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) algorithm. It can index static data set using an incremental extension, a continuous edge optimization. The resulting graph is highly efficient in regards to the queries per seconds in relation to the received recall rate. crEG delivers state-of-the-art performance for indexed and unindexed queries (query is not part of the index).

## Performance

For the four data set above crEG delievered the best ANNS and exploration efficiency amoung all the tested graph-based algorithms.

***NOTE:** All experiments where conduced single threaded on a Ryzen 2700x CPU, operating at a constant core clock speed of 4GHz, and 64GB of DDR4 memory running at 2133MHz.
