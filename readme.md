# DEG: Fast Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search

The Dynamic Exploration Graph (DEG) is a graph-based algorithm for approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS). It indexes both static and dynamic datasets using three algorithms: incremental extension, continuous edge optimization, and vertex deletion. The resulting graph demonstrates high efficiency in terms of queries per second relative to the achieved recall rate. DEG provides state-of-the-art performance for both indexed and unindexed queries (where the query is not part of the index).

## Release

- [2024/05/01] Our paper [An Exploration Graph with Continuous Refinement for Efficient Multimedia Retrieval](https://doi.org/10.1145/3652583.3658117) is accepted by ICMR2024 as **oral presentation**
- [2023/12/02] New continuous refining Exploration Graph (crEG) containing a more efficient and thread-safe way to extend DEG. Currently found in the [crEG branch](https://github.com/Visual-Computing/DynamicExplorationGraph/tree/crEG) of this repository.
- [2023/07/19] First version of Dynamic Exploration Graph is out! For more details please refere to our paper:

## Performance

In order to reproduce our results please checkout the `\cpp\` directory and its readme file. For the four data set above DEG delievered the best ANNS and exploration efficiency amoung all the tested graph-based algorithms.

***NOTE:** All experiments where conduced single threaded on a Ryzen 2700x CPU, operating at a constant core clock speed of 4GHz, and 64GB of DDR4 memory running at 2133MHz.
