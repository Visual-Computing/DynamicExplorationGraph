# DEG: Fast Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search

The Dynamic Exploration Graph (DEG) is a graph-based algorithm for approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS). It indexes both static and dynamic datasets using three algorithms: incremental extension, continuous edge optimization, and vertex deletion. The resulting graph demonstrates high efficiency in terms of queries per second relative to the achieved recall rate. DEG provides state-of-the-art performance for both indexed and unindexed queries (where the query is not part of the index).

## Usage
For a short introduction on how to use deglib for vector search, see our [Python Examples](python/README.md#examples).

## Release

- [2025/01/09] The latest iteration of DEG uses a more efficient way of removing and adding a vertex. More details can be found in our new paper [Dynamic Exploration Graph: A Novel Approach for Efficient Nearest Neighbor Search in Evolving Multimedia Datasets](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-96-2054-8_25).
- [2024/05/01] Our paper [An Exploration Graph with Continuous Refinement for Efficient Multimedia Retrieval](https://doi.org/10.1145/3652583.3658117) is accepted by ICMR2024 as **oral presentation**
- [2023/12/02] The new continuous refining Exploration Graph (crEG) containing a more efficient and thread-safe way to extend DEG. Currently found in the [crEG branch](https://github.com/Visual-Computing/DynamicExplorationGraph/tree/crEG) of this repository.
- [2023/07/19] First version of Dynamic Exploration Graph is out! For more details please refere to our paper:
