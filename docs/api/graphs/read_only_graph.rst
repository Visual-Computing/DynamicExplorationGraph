ReadOnlyGraph
=============

The ReadOnlyGraph can not be modified. It is usually created using a `MutableGraph`.

.. autoclass:: deglib.graph.ReadOnlyGraph
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:
   :exclude-members: to_cpp
   :member-order: bysource

.. autofunction:: deglib.graph.load_readonly_graph
